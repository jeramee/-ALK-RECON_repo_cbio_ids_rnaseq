# -ALK-RECON_repo_cbio_ids_rnaseq
ALK-RECON (cbio_ids + rnaseq) is a research/education pipeline starter kit that converts ALK-focused ctDNA/NGS variant tables—optionally enriched with cBioPortal study/sample identifiers and RNA-seq expression context—into a structured, auditable mechanism report (on-target vs bypass vs persistence). This project is not medical advice.
